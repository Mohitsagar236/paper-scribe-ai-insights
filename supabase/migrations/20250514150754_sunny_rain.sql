  # Storage Configuration Migration
  
  This migration has been removed since storage bucket creation and policy management
  should be handled through the Supabase Dashboard or Storage API instead of direct SQL
  due to permission restrictions.
  
  The following operations should be performed via the client-side storage API:
  1. Bucket creation
  2. RLS policy configuration
  3. Access control setup
  
  See src/utils/supabase-storage.ts for the implementation.

-- No SQL operations needed - storage configuration handled via API
